# KotlinJetpackInAction
A super-simple project demonstrating how to use Kotlin and Jetpack step by step.

## Why this project?

- I made this project as simple as possible, so that we can focus on how to use Kotlin and Jetpack to **improve** it.
- We will rewrite it from "Java + MVC" to "Kotlin + Coroutines + Jetpack + Clean MVVM", line by line, commit by commit.
